### Instructions

- Walk to the pogo stick and Jamie will jump on it 
- When on the pogo stick, Jamie will bounce around automatically. Control their movement as you would normally 
- At the top left of the screen you'll see Jamie's bounce level. The higher the bounce level, the higher Jamie will go. 
- To increase bounce level, do a timed bounce; touch and release the screen in time with Jamie's jumps (IE release as they are leaving the ground). If you get the timing wrong you'll hear a sad boing.
- To increase the maximum bounce level, collect the green arrow powerups 
- What happens when you've reached the MAX bounce level, but in your hubris continue to do timed bounces anyway? Well, don't say I didn't warn you

This was a lot of fun. Thanks!
